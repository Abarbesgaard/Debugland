The Debugland project aims to enhance the debugging experience during runtime, basically its aim is to make debugging more coherent and readable.

Key Features:

**Method Lifecycle Tracking:** Monitor the lifespan of your methods, from initialization to termination, with detailed timing information.

**SQL Command Debugging:** Effortlessly debug SQL commands, track SQL reader initialization and termination, and manage SQL connections.

**Variable Declaration Tracking:** Stay informed about the declaration of variables, including the option to log variable values.

**Exception Handling Blocks:** Keep an eye on the initiation and termination of try, catch, and finally blocks for effective exception handling.

**User-Friendly Debug Messages:** Write custom debug messages, important notices, and failure messages to streamline your debugging process.
